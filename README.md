# A Frequency-Aware Hybrid CNN–Transformer for Image Manipulation Localization

## Overview

This work investigates controlled architectural modifications to a hybrid CNN–Transformer image manipulation localization framework under the standardized Protocol-CAT setting. The overall framework of this project follows [Mesorch](https://github.com/scu-zjz/Mesorch}, replacing the Transformer backbone network with a CSWin-based architecture and introducing the Dice loss function to improve localization performance.
